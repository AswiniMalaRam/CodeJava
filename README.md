# CodeJava
This repository showcases my solutions to Java problems that emphasize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, collected from platforms such as HackerRank, LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerEarth.

The main goals of this repository are to:

    Practice and strengthen core OOP principles:
        Encapsulation
        Inheritance
        Polymorphism
        Abstraction
        
Apply OOP concepts to real-world style problems from popular coding platforms
