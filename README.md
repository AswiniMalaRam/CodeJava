# CodeJava
This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank problems focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts. The goal is to practice and demonstrate understanding of fundamental OOPS principles through practical problem-solving.

# Problem statement
You are given an array A consisting of K non-negative integers. Find out the minimum number K such that there exists a non-empty subset of A for which the bitwise OR of all its elements is equal to K.

## Input format
    The first line contains an integer T(1<=T<=1000) denoting the number of test cases.
    The first line of each test case contains an integer N(1<=N<=2*10^5 denoting the number of elements in array A.
    The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers of array A(0<=Ai<2^31).

## Output Format
For each test case, print a line containing the minimum possible value of K.
